- The loading system for the portals causes a stack overflow (I left a note why it could be happening)

- The Block Entities are a little bugged as the outputs either don't show or the BE plain out does not work

- The Portals themselves, the portal generator does not want to work, the handheld portal generators work, but the portal linking is unusual, the portals don't let people entirely go through all of the time, like the surface where the portal is placed blocks the entity from going in, and entities rendered through the portal get washed out textures.
